I am a product designer with over 15 years experience in online and application design across both Europe and Australia. I have experience working with small and large agencies, large media corporations and global financial institutions.

I like to work with integrated teams of developers and information architects that work together to create products that achieve a good balance between business demands and the needs of users. I have extensive experience in this process, beyond just colouring in wireframes. I enjoy being part of the business process including brainstorming, developing business strategies, development meetings and having an integral role in the overall product lifecycle.
