I am a graphic designer with over 10 years experience in online and application design in both Europe and Australia. I have experience working with small and large agencies, large media corporations and global financial institutions.

I like to work with integrated teams of developers and information architects that work together to create products which achieve a good balance between business demands and the needs of users. I have extensive experience in this process, beyond just colouring in wireframes. I enjoy being part of the business process including brain storming, developing business strategies, development meetings and having an integral role in the overall product lifecycle.

In the last two years I have been working in London. During this time I held two major roles. My first role was a Visual Designer for [Detica][0] where I designed online applications in telecommunications and designed a major website rebrand. My second role in London was a Mobile Application Designer for a large global investment bank, which I secured through [RMA Consulting][1]. Previously, in Sydney, I was Design Team Lead for [news.com.au][2].

I am moving back to Sydney in December 2012\. If you have a role or project that you would like to discuss with me, [please get in touch][3]. I would love to meet you (or your team) to hear about it.

If you want to get to know me a bit better you can find me around the internet at places like [Twitter][4], [Linkedin][5]and [Instagram][6].

If you would like more information on my recent work, [please continue reading here][7]. Or please have a look at some of my eariler work below.
